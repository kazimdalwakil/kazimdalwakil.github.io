Hello, thank you for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate learner and researcher with a huge interest in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Neural Network and Natural Language Processing. I am looking forward to working on similar research projects that match my interests. 

Currently working as Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the department of Computer Science and Engineering and in my last semester of my undergraduate left with Thesis Defense. 

I am doing research on Human Computer Interaction(HCI), working with the brain signals(EEG) to detect a personâ€™s mood then to recommend suitable contents in order to improve the personâ€™s mood. Concurrently doing a similar research to recommend music while driving. 

Photography always fascinated me. That is why I like to tell stories through photography and have been doing it since 2013. I used to do all sorts of photography at first, but for a few years I have been doing <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/kazimdalwakil_/'>street photography</a> only. I have done both basic and foundation photography courses from <a href = 'https://pathshalainstitute.org/'>Pathshala South Asian Media Institute</a>

In my spare time I enjoy watching Animes or Series and Movies. I also enjoy traveling, reading books, writing and going out for a photowalk or just hanging out with friends and family. I follow club football and am a big fan of Barcelona and Messi.
