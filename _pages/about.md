Hello, thank you for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated learner and researcher with an insatiable curiosity for the realms of technology and creativity. My journey has been a tapestry woven with threads of machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. These areas have always ignited my passion and continue to be my guiding stars.

Currently, I'm on an exciting journey as a Software Engineer Intern at mPower Social Enterprise Ltd, where I get the opportunity to harness my skills in JavaScript and Node.js to create innovative projects and collaborate with an outstanding team. This role allows me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, where problem-solving and creativity intersect to bring solutions to life.

Previously, I had the privilege of serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for 1.5 years. During this time, I mentored and assisted fellow students, helping them navigate the intricacies of object-oriented programming while sharpening their analytical thinking abilities. It was a rewarding experience that further cemented my passion for both teaching and technology.

My journey extends beyond the classroom and office. Since 2013, I've been a storyteller through the lens of a camera, capturing the world through the art of photography. While I initially explored various photography genres, my heart found its home in <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/kazimdalwakil_/'>street photography</a>, allowing me to capture the essence of life in its raw and unfiltered form. I've also honed my photographic skills by completing basic and foundation photography courses at <a href = 'https://pathshalainstitute.org/'>Pathshala South Asian Media Institute</a>

But my truest passions lie in the worlds of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. I'm on a mission to contribute my research knowledge and skills to these fields, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. My ultimate desire is to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share the same fervour for research, innovation, and the pursuit of the extraordinary in these exhilarating domains.

In my spare time I enjoy watching Animes or Series and Movies. I also enjoy traveling, reading books, writing and going out for a photowalk or just hanging out with friends and family. I follow club football and am a big fan of Barcelona and Messi. 

You can checkout the list of books that I have read as well as the list of movie, series and anime too.
