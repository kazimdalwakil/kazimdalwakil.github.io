Hello, thank you for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated learnersssss and researcher with an insatiable curiosity for the realms of technology and creativity. My journey has been a tapestry woven with threads of machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer Vision, and natural language processing. These areas have always ignited my passion and continue to be my guiding stars.

Currently, I'm on an exciting journey as a Software Engineer at mPower Social Enterprise Ltd, where  I specialize in MERN stack to drive innovation and collaborate on transformative projects with an exceptional team. This role fuels my passion for problem-solving and creativity, allowing me to apply my expertise to real-world challenges.

In addition to my role at mPower Social, I'm actively engaged in research projects focusing on computer vision. Exploring this domain allows me to push the boundaries of technology and contribute to cutting-edge advancements.

Before joining mPower Social, I served as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in Computer Science and Engineering, mentoring students in object-oriented programming and honing my skills in analytical thinking. This experience reinforced my dual passion for teaching and technology.

My truest passions lie in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. I'm committed to contributing to these fields and collaborating with fellow enthusiasts to achieve extraordinary results.

My journey extends beyond the classroom and office. Since 2013, I've been a storyteller through the lens of a camera, capturing the world through the art of photography. While I initially explored various photography genres, my heart found its home in <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/kazimdalwakil_/'>street photography</a>, allowing me to capture the essence of life in its raw and unfiltered form. I've also honed my photographic skills by completing basic and foundation photography courses at <a href = 'https://pathshalainstitute.org/'>Pathshala South Asian Media Institute</a>

Moreover, In my spare time I enjoy watching Animes or Series and Movies. I also enjoy traveling, reading books, writing and going out for a photowalk or just hanging out with friends and family. I follow club football and am a big fan of Barcelona and Messi. 

You can checkout the list of books that I have read as well as the list of movie, series and anime too.
