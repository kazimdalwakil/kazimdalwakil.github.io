Assalamu Alaikum/Hello, I’m Kazi Md. Al-Wakil from Dhaka, Bangladesh, currently a Lecturer at Northern University Bangladesh (NUB),  with a strong passion for research and innovation in Computer Science. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in CS, and now, I am diving deeper into machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision, focusing on impactful research to solve real-world problems.

Previously, I served as a Software Engineer at mPower Social Enterprise Ltd, where I specialized in the MERN stack, and as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, guiding students in object-oriented programming. These roles have shaped my expertise in both teaching and industry-driven problem-solving.

Beyond academics, I’ve been a storyteller through photography since 2013, specializing in street photography. My work reflects the raw beauty of everyday life and has been refined through training at Pathshala South Asian Media Institute.

I am actively seeking fully-funded Graduate Research Student positions in top CS research labs to further my contribution to technology and innovation. Let’s connect if you’re interested in collaborating on research, startups, or educational projects.
