                The main motive of this thesis is to create a system where emotions can be detected by processing brain activity (EEG signals). 
                Make the best use of data we already have in order to create a prototype which can be used later on in a large scale. 
                We will try to analyze which algorithm will work best, whether it's a traditional model or deep learning model.
                Later on, we implemented a recommendation system based on the fusion of two prevalent techniques, creating a hybrid recommendation system. 
                Furthermore, concepts of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) have been implemented to come up 
                with an efficient algorithm which works in stabilizing an individual’s mood gradually."
