description: In today's fast-paced world, mental health is often overlooked, and consuming unsuitable content can worsen emotional well-being. We propose a recommendation system combining collaborative filtering and emotional analysis using NLP to suggest mood-enhancing content. Collaborative filtering identifies user preferences, while emotional analysis evaluates video emotions. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), we refine and rank recommendations for balanced, uplifting suggestions to improve mental health.
