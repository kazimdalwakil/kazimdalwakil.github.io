description: We propose a system to enhance mental well-being by recommending “Feel Good” YouTube videos. Using the SEED Dataset (EEG signals and eye movements), we applied CNN and LSTM models, with CNN achieving 93.01% accuracy in mood detection. For recommendations, we combined text-based emotion analysis, Pearson Correlation for viewer ratings, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to refine mood-stabilizing algorithms. This system detects emotional states and boosts well-being through targeted content, offering a practical tool for emotional health improvement.
