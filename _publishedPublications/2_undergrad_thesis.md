description: In an era of rapid technological advancement, the significance of mental health is often overshadowed. Daily content consumption visibly affects emotional well-being—for example, melancholic songs can induce sadness, while inspirational movies uplift spirits. Building on this idea, we propose a system to recommend “Feel Good” YouTube videos to stabilize individuals’ moods. Using the SEED Dataset comprising EEG signals and eye movement data, we applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models after extracting and fusing four features. Our comparative analysis revealed CNN as the optimal approach, achieving 93.01% accuracy. For content recommendation, we employed text classification to identify video emotions and Pearson Correlation to match viewer ratings with content. Additionally, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was integrated to develop an efficient algorithm for gradual mood stabilization.This innovative system merges two goals detecting emotional states via EEG analysis and enhancing well-being through personalized recommendations, offering a tool to understand and improve emotional health.
