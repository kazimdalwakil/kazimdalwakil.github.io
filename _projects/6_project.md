title: Wildfire Prediction Using Machine Learning
projectCategory: Data Science - Coding With Real-World Data
authors: Anika Tahsin, Kazi Md. Al-Wakil
description: This project focuses on predicting the confidence of forest fires based on various attributes related to different cases and areas of forest fires. The goal is to better understand when wildfires are likely to occur and estimate their severity. As a regression problem, the project employs several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. To assess the performance of these models, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the evaluation metric. The ultimate aim is to predict the likelihood and intensity of forest fires, which can assist in better forest management and preparedness.

Scholars and forest managers have been intrigued for many years by the difficulty of predicting the incidence of wildfires. Attempts to understand the conditions that lead to the ignition and spread of wildfires can be dated at least 150 years back. It is now utmost important to predict when the wildfires will begin and how big will it be. 

In this project, we are trying to predict the confidence of the forest fire based on some attributes in different cases and areas of forest fire.

As it is a regression problem, we have used,
- Linear regression
- Decision Tree
- Random forest
- Support Vector Machine
- KNN
- Adaboost
- Ridge
- Lasso

For the evaluation of the models we have used Root Mean Square Error.
