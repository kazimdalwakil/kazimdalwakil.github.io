In this project I had to build a 4-Bit Alu that can perform 4 operations(X-NOR, SUB, NAND, ADD). The constraint was to code the project in such a way that operations are done bit-wise. 

The ALU takes two four-bit inputs: A, B and Three-bit operation Code (opcode). Based on the opcode, it performs four different operations on A and B and produces a four-bit output, C. Depending on the result of a particular operation, the ALU also produces three flags: carry, zero and sign flag.

The whole project was done in the Quartus and used Verilog programming language.
