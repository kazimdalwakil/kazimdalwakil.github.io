It was November of 2022. The biggest sport event of the world Fifa world cup has begun. Therefore, couple of our friends thought of this idea to predict the every match's score. It was purely for entertainment and for the sake of increasing the excitement of the world cup. 

In this project, we developed a system where we can predict the score of every match (before the match starts) and after certain criteria we get points based on that. The whole prediction system is implemented on google sheet. All the rules and the project implementations are shown below. 

After the world cup ended, the winner was the one with the highest point.
