In this project we built a whole network for a given scenario. There were many constraints which we had to take into consideration. The main objective was to create a system where we can set up a network by which we can communicate with the whole network. Constraints that we had to take into consideration:
- Shortest path to each of the node
- Creating primary, secondary routes and default route
- Using both DHCP and Manually assigned IP addresses
- Setting up Email Server, Web server
