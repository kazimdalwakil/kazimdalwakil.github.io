title: Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning
authors: Kazi Md. Al-Wakil, Ahmed Lateef, Arman Zaman
projectCategory: Artificial Intelligence course project
description: This machine learning project aims to classify whether a person has diabetes based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, originally provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset includes diagnostic measurements to predict the presence of diabetes. After pre-processing the data, it was split into 75% for training and 25% for testing. Three classification models were used to achieve the prediction- Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Neighbors Classifier. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in healthcare diagnostics.

It is a simple Machine Learning project where I tried to classify if a person has Diabetes or not. I collected the dataset from Kaggle.

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database">Dataset Link</a>

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 

After pre-processing the dataset, I splitted the dataset into 75:25 ratio. 75% data for training and 25% data for testing.  

I used three classification models:
- Decision tree
- Random Forest 
- K-neighbors classifier
