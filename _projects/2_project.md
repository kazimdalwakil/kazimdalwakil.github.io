description: I have developed a full-stack web application where students, faculties, staff of BRAC University can Rent anything. It's not very uncommon for us to leave important things behind at home when we actually need it. For example, we might forget to take our calculator with us when we are having a math exam or we forget to take our charger but we need to charge our phone at university.In these cases, the website will be handy. Users can rent almost any necessary things from here.

In this project I have developed a full-stack web application where students, faculties, staff of BRAC University can Rent anything. It's not very uncommon for us to leave important things behind at home when we actually need it. For example, we might forget to take our calculator with us when we are having a math exam or we forget to take our charger but we need to charge our phone at university.In these cases, the website will be handy. Users can rent almost any necessary things from here.

For the development of the project, PHP Laravel framework was used and HTML, CSS as the frontend. In order to construct this website I have used the Test-First-Development approach. Moreover, the whole project was built using the MVC architecture.

Tools I used for this project:
- PHP Laravel Framework
- MySQL Database
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
